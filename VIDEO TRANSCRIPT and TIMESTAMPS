00:00 - B1.2 (Introduction to my parts of the code / how our group divided the code)
  - stats
  - super power
  - game base code (action loop)
  - stage 1, 7, 10

1:00 - A1.1 (declaring and modifying variables)
  -stats variables
  - modification example
  
2:10 - A2.2 (Conditional loops)
  - input/options
  - loop breaks after desired output
  - loop back to start if player response mistyped
  
3:27 - A3.1 (Existing sub-programs)
  - declaring new variables for final boss health

4:38 - My favourite parts of the code
  - jeffrey_saved variable to determine future outcomes
